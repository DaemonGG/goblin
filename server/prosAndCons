// Compared to traditional way of implementing rpc service, using jason as a unified string to convey request information has the following benefits.
1. Dynamically add and delete new service without adding new codes.
2. Reuse the codes written to execute configuration tasks (background fetch), to handle rpc requests.
3. Clearly list all kinds of supported RPC types in the same json file as the one listing all background fetching tasks.
